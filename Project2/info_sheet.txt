Assignment #:  2

Program due date:  3/1/2020

Handed in date:  3/1/2020

Source code file name(s):

MyLZW.java





Other file name(s) (if relevant):







Does your program run without error?: no

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:


Everything works correctly except the reinitialization of the array in expansion when ratioRatios is greater than 1.1. When it hits this statement, a null pointer exception occurs, even though I reset the array.
(I just made a quick change and it works now)




Additional comments to the grader:

When I compressed my files using Winzip for Mac, the size of the original file was a little less than what was shown on my computer when I dowloaded it. Because of this, the compressed sizes using Winzip for Mac are probably a bit smaller.
